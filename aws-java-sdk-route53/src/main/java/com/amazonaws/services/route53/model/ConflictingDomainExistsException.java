/**
 * <p>
 * The cause of this error depends on whether you're trying to create a public or a private hosted zone:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Public hosted zone:</b> Two hosted zones that have the same name or that have a parent/child relationship
 * (example.com and test.example.com) can't have any common name servers. You tried to create a hosted zone that has the
 * same name as an existing hosted zone or that's the parent or child of an existing hosted zone, and you specified a
 * delegation set that shares one or more name servers with the existing hosted zone. For more information, see
 * <a>CreateReusableDelegationSet</a>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Private hosted zone:</b> You specified an Amazon VPC that you're already using for another hosted zone, and the
 * domain that you specified for one of the hosted zones is a subdomain of the domain that you specified for the other
 * hosted zone. For example, you can't use the same Amazon VPC for the hosted zones for example.com and
 * test.example.com.
