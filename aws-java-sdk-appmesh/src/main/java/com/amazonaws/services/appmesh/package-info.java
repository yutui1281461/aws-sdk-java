/**
 * <p>
 * AWS App Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy that makes it easy to monitor and control containerized
 * microservices. App Mesh standardizes how your microservices communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping
 * to ensure high-availability for your applications.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every microservice in an application. You
 * can use App Mesh with Amazon ECS (using the Amazon EC2 launch type), Amazon EKS, and Kubernetes on AWS.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * App Mesh supports containerized microservice applications that use service discovery naming for their components. To
 * use App Mesh, you must have a containerized application running on Amazon EC2 instances, hosted in either Amazon ECS,
 * Amazon EKS, or Kubernetes on AWS. For more information about service discovery on Amazon ECS, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html">Service Discovery</a> in the
 * <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. Kubernetes <code>kube-dns</code> is supported. For more
 * information, see <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/">DNS for Services
 * and Pods</a> in the Kubernetes documentation.
