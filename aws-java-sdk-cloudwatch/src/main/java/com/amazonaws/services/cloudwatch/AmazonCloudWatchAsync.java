/**
 * Interface for accessing CloudWatch asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object
 * representing the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be used to receive
 * notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.cloudwatch.AbstractAmazonCloudWatchAsync} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time.
 * You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your resources
 * and applications.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you
 * define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances. Then, use
 * this data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this
 * data to stop under-used instances to save money.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can monitor your own custom metrics. With
 * CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational
 * health.
 * </p>

     * <p>
     * The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If you request more than 1,440 data
     * points, CloudWatch returns an error. To reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range
     * and make multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period. Data points are
     * not returned in chronological order.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you specify. For example, if you request
     * statistics with a one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each
     * one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data
     * points returned.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set
     * instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are
     * high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a
     * <code>StorageResolution</code> of 1.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For
     * example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute
     * resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution
     * of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.

     * <p>
     * When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to <code>INSUFFICIENT_DATA</code>. The

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you are using an IAM role (for example, an EC2 instance profile), you cannot stop or terminate the instance
