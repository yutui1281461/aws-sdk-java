 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.cloudwatch.AbstractAmazonCloudWatch} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time.
 * You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your resources
 * and applications.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you
 * define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances. Then, use
 * this data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this
 * data to stop under-used instances to save money.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can monitor your own custom metrics. With
 * CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational
 * health.

     * <p>
     * A simple way to create a dashboard using <code>PutDashboard</code> is to copy an existing dashboard. To copy an
     * existing dashboard using the console, you can load the dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in the
     * Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard. Another way to copy a dashboard is to use
     * <code>GetDashboard</code>, and then use the data returned within <code>DashboardBody</code> as the template for
     * the new dashboard when you call <code>PutDashboard</code>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When you create a dashboard with <code>PutDashboard</code>, a good practice is to add a text widget at the top of
     * the dashboard with a message that the dashboard was created by script and should not be changed in the console.
     * This message could also point console users to the location of the <code>DashboardBody</code> script or the
     * CloudFormation template used to create the dashboard.

     * Creates or updates an alarm and associates it with the specified metric or metric math expression.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to <code>INSUFFICIENT_DATA</code>. The
     * alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then
     * executed.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous
     * configuration of the alarm.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you are an IAM user, you must have Amazon EC2 permissions for some alarm operations:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole</code> for all alarms with EC2 actions
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus</code> and <code>ec2:DescribeInstances</code> for all alarms on EC2 instance
     * status metrics
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>ec2:StopInstances</code> for alarms with stop actions
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>ec2:TerminateInstances</code> for alarms with terminate actions
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>ec2:DescribeInstanceRecoveryAttribute</code> and <code>ec2:RecoverInstances</code> for alarms with recover
     * actions
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * If you have read/write permissions for Amazon CloudWatch but not for Amazon EC2, you can still create an alarm,
     * but the stop or terminate actions are not performed. However, if you are later granted the required permissions,
     * the alarm actions that you created earlier are performed.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you are using an IAM role (for example, an EC2 instance profile), you cannot stop or terminate the instance
     * using alarm actions. However, you can still see the alarm state and perform any other actions such as Amazon SNS
     * notifications or Auto Scaling policies.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you are using temporary security credentials granted using AWS STS, you cannot stop or terminate an EC2
     * instance using alarm actions.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The first time you create an alarm in the AWS Management Console, the CLI, or by using the PutMetricAlarm API,
     * CloudWatch creates the necessary service-linked role for you. The service-linked role is called
     * <code>AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents</code>. For more information, see <a href=

     * Publishes metric data points to Amazon CloudWatch. CloudWatch associates the data points with the specified

     * it can take up to fifteen minutes for the metric to appear in calls to <a>ListMetrics</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can publish either individual data points in the <code>Value</code> field, or arrays of values and the number
     * of times each value occurred during the period by using the <code>Values</code> and <code>Counts</code> fields in
     * the <code>MetricDatum</code> structure. Using the <code>Values</code> and <code>Counts</code> method enables you
     * to publish up to 150 values per metric with one <code>PutMetricData</code> request, and supports retrieving
     * percentile statistics on this data.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Each <code>PutMetricData</code> request is limited to 40 KB in size for HTTP POST requests. You can send a
     * payload compressed by gzip. Each request is also limited to no more than 20 different metrics.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Although the <code>Value</code> parameter accepts numbers of type <code>Double</code>, CloudWatch rejects values
     * that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the range of 8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10)
     * or 2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2). In addition, special values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not
     * supported.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can use up to 10 dimensions per metric to further clarify what data the metric collects. For more information
     * about specifying dimensions, see <a
     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html">Publishing
     * Metrics</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Data points with time stamps from 24 hours ago or longer can take at least 48 hours to become available for

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set
     * instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
