Updates made to the source database are asynchronously copied to the Read Replicas. In addition to providing scalability for read-heavy workloads, you can choose to promote a Read Replica to become standalone a DB instance when needed.Amazon RDS Multi-AZ Deployments provide enhanced availability for database instances within a single AWS Region. With Multi-AZ, your data is synchronously replicated to a standby in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, minimizing disruption to your applications.You can now combine Read Replicas with Multi-AZ as part of a disaster recovery strategy for your production databases. A well-designed and tested plan is critical for maintaining business continuity after a disaster. Since Read Replicas can also be created in different regions than the source database, your Read Replica can be promoted to become the new production database in case of a regional disruption.You can also combine Read Replicas with Multi-AZ for your database engine upgrade process. You can create a Read Replica of your production database instance and upgrade it to a new database engine version. When the upgrade is complete, you can stop applications, promote the Read Replica to a standalone database instance and switch over your applications. Since the database instance is already a Multi-AZ deployment, no additional steps are needed.For more information, see the Amazon RDS User Guide.

      This fixes [#1102](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/1102)

# __1.11.118__ __2017-04-07__
## __Amazon Redshift__
  - ### Features
    - This update adds the GetClusterCredentials API which is used to get temporary login credentials to the cluster. AccountWithRestoreAccess now has a new member AccountAlias, this is the identifier of the AWS support account authorized to restore the specified snapshot. This is added to support the feature where the customer can share their snapshot with the Amazon Redshift Support Account without having to manually specify the AWS Redshift Service account ID on the AWS Console/API.

# __1.11.117__ __2017-04-06__
## __Elastic Load Balancing__

## __Amazon CloudWatch__
  - ### Features
    - Amazon Web Services announced the immediate availability of two additional alarm configuration rules for Amazon CloudWatch Alarms. The first rule is for configuring missing data treatment. Customers have the options to treat missing data as alarm threshold breached, alarm threshold not breached, maintain alarm state and the current default treatment. The second rule is for alarms based on percentiles metrics that can trigger unnecassarily if the percentile is calculated from a small number of samples. The new rule can treat percentiles with low sample counts as same as missing data. If the first rule is enabled, the same treatment will be applied when an alarm encounters a percentile with low sample counts.

# __1.11.114__ __2017-04-03__

## __AWS Resource Groups Tagging API__
  - ### Features
    - Resource Groups Tagging APIs can help you organize your resources and enable you to simplify resource management, access management, and cost allocation.

## __AWS Storage Gateway__
  - ### Features
    - File gateway mode in AWS Storage gateway provides access to objects in S3 as files on a Network File System (NFS) mount point. Once a file share is created, any changes made externally to the S3 bucket will not be reflected by the gateway. Using the cache refresh feature in this update, the customer can trigger an on-demand scan of the keys in their S3 bucket and refresh the file namespace cached on the gateway. It takes as an input the fileShare ARN and refreshes the cache for only that file share. Additionally there is new functionality on file gateway that allows you configure what squash options they would like on their file share, this allows a customer to configure their gateway to not squash root permissions. This can be done by setting options in NfsOptions for CreateNfsFileShare and UpdateNfsFileShare APIs.

## __Amazon CloudFront__
  - ### Features
    - Amazon CloudFront now supports user configurable HTTP Read and Keep-Alive Idle Timeouts for your Custom Origin Servers

# __1.11.111__ __2017-03-28__
## __AWS Batch__
  - ### Features
    - Customers can now provide a retryStrategy as part of the RegisterJobDefinition and SubmitJob API calls. The retryStrategy object has a number value for attempts. This is the number of non successful executions before a job is considered FAILED. In addition, the JobDetail object now has an attempts field and shows all execution attempts.

## __Amazon EC2__
  - ### Features
    - Customers can now tag their Amazon EC2 Instances and Amazon EBS Volumes at the time of their creation. You can do this from the EC2 Instance launch wizard or through the RunInstances or CreateVolume APIs. By tagging resources at the time of creation, you can eliminate the need to run custom tagging scripts after resource creation. In addition, you can now set resource-level permissions on the CreateVolume, CreateTags, DeleteTags, and the RunInstances APIs. This allows you to implement stronger security policies by giving you more granular control over which users and groups have access to these APIs. You can also enforce the use of tagging and control what tag keys and values are set on your resources. When you combine tag usage and resource-level IAM policies together, you can ensure your instances and volumes are properly secured upon creation and achieve more accurate cost allocation reporting. These new features are provided at no additional cost.

      final AmazonEC2 ec2 = AmazonEC2ClientBuilder.defaultClient();
      try {
          ec2.waiters().instanceExists().runAsync(
              new WaiterParameters<>(new DescribeInstancesRequest()), 
              new WaiterHandler() {...}
          );
      } finally {
          ec2.shutdown(); //this will now shutdown the waiters as well as the client    
      }
      ```

    - This update will introduce the ability for Direct Connect customers to take advantage of Link Aggregation (LAG). This allows you to bundle many individual physical interfaces into a single logical interface, referred to as a LAG. This makes administration much simpler as the majority of configuration is done on the LAG while you are free to add or remove physical interfaces from the bundle as bandwidth demand increases or decreases. A concrete example of the simplification added by LAG is that customers need only a single BGP session as opposed to one session per physical connection.

# __1.11.92__ __2017-02-16__
## __AWS Config__
  - ### Features
    - AWS Config now supports a new test mode for the PutEvaluations API.

## __AWS Storage Gateway__
  - ### Features
    - File gateway mode in AWS Storage gateway provides access to objects in S3 as files on a Network File System (NFS) mount point. This is done by creating Nfs file shares using existing APIs CreateNfsFileShare. Using the feature in this update, the customer can restrict the clients that have read/write access to the gateway by specifying the list of clients as a list of IP addresses or CIDR blocks. This list can be specified using the API CreateNfsFileShare while creating new file shares, or UpdateNfsFileShare while update existing file shares. To find out the list of clients that have access, the existing API DescribeNfsFileShare will now output the list of clients that have access.

      ```java
      AmazonSNS client = AmazonSNSClientBuilder.standard().withEndpointConfiguration(new EndpointConfiguration("http://sns-custom-endpoint.amazon.com", "us-east-1")).build();
      ```
      _NB: This should only be used if a custom endpoint is required, the recommended approach for configuring a client is via set/withRegion on the builder_
    - Bundled dependency of AWS SDK jar available as a new maven module 'aws-java-sdk-bundle'. This module includes all service and dependent JARs with third-party libraries relocated to different namespaces.

  - ### Deprecations
    - Deprecating `com.amazonaws.regions.Region.createClient`, clients should be created via their builder implementation for example:

      ```java
      AmazonSNSClientBuilder.standard().withRegion(region).build();
      ```
    - Deprecating client constructors & mutation methods on clients (eg `setRegion`) in favor of creating a client via the client builders. The following mechanism for creating clients is deprecated:

      ```java
      AmazonSNSClient client = new AmazonSNSClient(clientConfiguration); //client constructor is deprecated
      client.setRegion(RegionUtils.getRegion("us-east-1"));              //mutating the client via setRegion is deprecated
      ```

      Clients should now be constructed using the builder:

      ```java
      AmazonSNS client = AmazonSNSClientBuilder.standard().withClientConfiguration(clientConfiguration).withRegion("us-east-1").build();
      ```

      ```java
      TransferManager tm = TransferManagerBuilder.standard().withS3Client(s3Client).build();
      ```

# __1.11.83__ __2017-01-20__
## __AWS Certificate Manager__
  - ### Features
    - Updated response elements for DescribeCertificate API in support of managed renewal.

# __1.11.82__ __2017-01-20__
## __Amazon DynamoDB__
  - ### Deprecations
    - Deprecating [waitForActiveOrDelete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForActiveOrDelete--) and [waitForAllActiveOrDelete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForAllActiveOrDelete--) methods in Table class which can give incorrect results if they are called immediatedly after creating or deleting a table. This is due to dynamoDb operations being eventually consistent and might take a few seconds to propagate the new status. Use [waitForActive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForActive--) and [waitForDelete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForDelete--) instead.
