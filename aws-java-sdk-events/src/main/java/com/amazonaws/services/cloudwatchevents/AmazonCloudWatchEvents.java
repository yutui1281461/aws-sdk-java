/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon CloudWatch Events.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.cloudwatchevents.AbstractAmazonCloudWatchEvents} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources. When your resources change
 * state, they automatically send events into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the
 * stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule.
 * For example, you can configure rules to:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance
 * enters the running state.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Direct specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of potential
 * security or availability risks.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For more information about the features of Amazon CloudWatch Events, see the <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events">Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide</a>.

     * Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However, CloudWatch

     * event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In CloudWatch Events, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired
     * repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to
     * change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires
     * the rule again, creating an infinite loop.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your
     * rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which

     * Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the AWS Management Console. The built-in targets are
     * <code>EC2 CreateSnapshot API call</code>, <code>EC2 RebootInstances API call</code>,
     * <code>EC2 StopInstances API call</code>, and <code>EC2 TerminateInstances API call</code>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For some target types, <code>PutTargets</code> provides target-specific parameters. If the target is a Kinesis
     * data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the <code>KinesisParameters</code>
     * argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the
     * <code>RunCommandParameters</code> field.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon CloudWatch Events needs the appropriate
     * permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, CloudWatch Events relies on resource-based policies. For
     * EC2 instances, Kinesis data streams, and AWS Step Functions state machines, CloudWatch Events relies on IAM roles
     * that you specify in the <code>RoleARN</code> argument in <code>PutTargets</code>. For more information, see <a
     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/auth-and-access-control-cwe.html">Authentication
     * and Access Control</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using <code>PutPermission</code>),
     * you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To
     * send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the <code>Arn</code> value when
     * you run <code>PutTargets</code>. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for
     * each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event
     * is not charged. For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/">Amazon CloudWatch
     * Pricing</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted permission to your
     * account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a
     * <code>RoleArn</code> with proper permissions in the <code>Target</code> structure. For more information, see <a
     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/CloudWatchEvents-CrossAccountEventDelivery.html">
     * Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide</i>.

     * <p>
     * <b>Input</b>, <b>InputPath</b>, and <b>InputTransformer</b> are mutually exclusive and optional parameters of a
     * target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then the entire event is passed to the target in
     * JSON format (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing from the event
     * is passed to the target).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If <b>Input</b> is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden with this constant.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If <b>InputPath</b> is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, <code>$.detail</code>), then only the part
     * of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the event is
     * passed).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If <b>InputTransformer</b> is specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from the event and
     * used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * When you specify <code>InputPath</code> or <code>InputTransformer</code>, you must use JSON dot notation, not
     * bracket notation.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated targets might not be
     * immediately invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.
