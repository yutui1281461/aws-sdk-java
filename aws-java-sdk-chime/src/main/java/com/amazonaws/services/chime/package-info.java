/**
 * <p>
 * The Amazon Chime API (application programming interface) is designed for administrators to use to perform key tasks,
 * such as creating and managing Amazon Chime accounts and users. This guide provides detailed information about the
 * Amazon Chime API, including operations, types, inputs and outputs, and error codes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the REST API to make API calls. We recommend
 * using an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI. Each API operation includes links to information about using it with a
 * language-specific AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Using an AWS SDK</dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * You don't need to write code to calculate a signature for request authentication. The SDK clients authenticate your
 * requests by using access keys that you provide. For more information about AWS SDKs, see the <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/developer/">AWS Developer Center</a>.
 * </p>
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Using the AWS CLI</dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * Use your access keys with the AWS CLI to make API calls. For information about setting up the AWS CLI, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html">Installing the AWS Command Line Interface</a>
 * in the <i>AWS Command Line Interface User Guide</i>. For a list of available Amazon Chime commands, see the <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/chime/index.html">Amazon Chime commands</a> in the <i>AWS CLI
 * Command Reference</i>.
 * </p>
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Using REST API</dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * If you use REST to make API calls, you must authenticate your request by providing a signature. Amazon Chime supports
 * signature version 4. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a>
 * in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When making REST API calls, use the service name <code>chime</code> and REST endpoint
 * <code>https://service.chime.aws.amazon.com</code>.
 * </p>
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * Administrative permissions are controlled using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). For more information, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/control-access.html">Control Access to the Amazon Chime
 * Console</a> in the <i>Amazon Chime Administration Guide</i>.
