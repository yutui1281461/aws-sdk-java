/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon Lightsail.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.lightsail.AbstractAmazonLightsail} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers who just need virtual private servers.
 * Lightsail includes everything you need to launch your project quickly - a virtual machine, SSD-based storage, data
 * transfer, DNS management, and a static IP - for a low, predictable price. You manage those Lightsail servers through
 * the Lightsail console or by using the API or command-line interface (CLI).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the <a
 * href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/all">Lightsail Dev Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use the Lightsail API or the CLI, you will need to use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to generate access
 * keys. For details about how to set this up, see the <a href=
 * "http://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/how-to/article/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli"

     * should unmount the disk from within the Lightsail instance, issue the create disk snapshot command, and then
     * remount the disk to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your disk while the

     * volume like you would for a block storage disk. To create a snapshot of a system volume, just define the

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Parameter updates don't cause outages; therefore, their application is not subject to the preferred maintenance
     * window. However, there are two ways in which paramater updates are applied: <code>dynamic</code> or
     * <code>pending-reboot</code>. Parameters marked with a <code>dynamic</code> apply type are applied immediately.
     * Parameters marked with a <code>pending-reboot</code> apply type are applied only after the database is rebooted
     * using the <code>reboot relational database</code> operation.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>update relational database parameters</code> operation supports tag-based access control via resource
     * tags applied to the resource identified by relationalDatabaseName. For more information, see the <a
     * href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags"
