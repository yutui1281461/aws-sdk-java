 * <p>
 * Use AWS Auto Scaling to quickly discover all the scalable AWS resources for your application and configure dynamic
 * scaling for your scalable resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To get started, create a scaling plan with a set of instructions used to configure dynamic scaling for the scalable
 * resources in your application. AWS Auto Scaling creates target tracking scaling policies for the scalable resources
 * in your scaling plan. Target tracking scaling policies adjust the capacity of your scalable resource as required to
 * maintain resource utilization at the target value that you specified.
