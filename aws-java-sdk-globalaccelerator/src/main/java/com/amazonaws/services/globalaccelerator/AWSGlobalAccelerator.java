/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS Global Accelerator.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from

 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS Global Accelerator</fullname>
 * <p>
 * This is the <i>AWS Global Accelerator API Reference</i>. This guide is for developers who need detailed information
 * about AWS Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator
 * features, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/Welcome.html">AWS Global
 * Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service in which you create accelerators to improve availability and
 * performance for internet applications used by a global audience.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. These IP addresses
 * are anycast from the AWS edge network and distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources
 * in multiple AWS Regions, which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints can be Elastic IP
 * addresses, Network Load Balancers, and Application Load Balancers that are located in one AWS Region or multiple
 * Regions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on health,
 * client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or configuration
 * to ensure that internet traffic from clients is directed to only healthy endpoints.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Global Accelerator includes components that work together to help you improve performance and availability for your
 * applications:
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Static IP address</dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * AWS Global Accelerator provides you with a set of static IP addresses which are anycast from the AWS edge network and
 * serve as the single fixed entry points for your clients. If you already have Elastic Load Balancing or Elastic IP
 * address resources set up for your applications, you can easily add those to Global Accelerator to allow the resources
 * to be accessed by a Global Accelerator static IP address.
 * </p>
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Accelerator</dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * An accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network to improve availability and
 * performance for your internet applications that have a global audience. Each accelerator includes one or more
 * listeners.
 * </p>
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Network zone</dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from a unique IP subnet. Similar to an AWS
 * Availability Zone, a network zone is an isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure. When you configure
 * an accelerator, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses for it. If one IP address from a network zone becomes
 * unavailable due to IP address blocking by certain client networks, or network disruptions, then client applications
 * can retry on the healthy static IP address from the other isolated network zone.
 * </p>
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Listener</dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator, based on the protocol and port that you
 * configure. Each listener has one or more endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic is forwarded to endpoints in
 * one of the groups. You associate endpoint groups with listeners by specifying the Regions that you want to distribute
 * traffic to. Traffic is distributed to optimal endpoints within the endpoint groups associated with a listener.
 * </p>
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Endpoint group</dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint groups include one or more endpoints in the
 * Region. You can increase or reduce the percentage of traffic that would be otherwise directed to an endpoint group by
 * adjusting a setting called a <i>traffic dial</i>. The traffic dial lets you easily do performance testing or
 * blue/green deployment testing for new releases across different AWS Regions, for example.
 * </p>
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Endpoint</dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * An endpoint is an Elastic IP address, Network Load Balancer, or Application Load Balancer. Traffic is routed to
 * endpoints based on several factors, including the geo-proximity to the user, the health of the endpoint, and the
 * configuration options that you choose, such as endpoint weights. For each endpoint, you can configure weights, which
 * are numbers that you can use to specify the proportion of traffic to route to each one. This can be useful, for
 * example, to do performance testing within a Region.
 * </p>
 * </dd>
