     *        <p>
     *        Media players typically build a timeline of media content to play, based on the time stamps of each
     *        fragment. This means that if there is any overlap between fragments (as is typical if
     *        <a>HLSFragmentSelector</a> is <code>SERVER_TIMESTAMP</code>), the media player timeline has small gaps
     *        between fragments in some places, and overwrites frames in other places. When there are discontinuity
     *        flags between fragments, the media player is expected to reset the timeline, resulting in the fragment
     *        being played immediately after the previous fragment. We recommend that you always have discontinuity
     *        flags between fragments if the fragment time stamps are not accurate or if fragments might be missing. You
     *        should not place discontinuity flags between fragments for the player timeline to accurately map to the
     *        producer time stamps.
