     * Retrieves an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) URL for the stream. You can then open the URL in a browser or media player
     * to view the stream contents.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You must specify either the <code>StreamName</code> or the <code>StreamARN</code>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for providing data through HLS:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The media type must be <code>video/h264</code>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Data retention must be greater than 0.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The fragments must contain codec private data in the AVC (Advanced Video Coding) for H.264 format (<a
     * href="https://www.iso.org/standard/55980.html">MPEG-4 specification ISO/IEC 14496-15</a>). For information about
     * adapting stream data to a given format, see <a
     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/latest/dg/producer-reference-nal.html">NAL
     * Adaptation Flags</a>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Kinesis Video Streams HLS sessions contain fragments in the fragmented MPEG-4 form (also called fMP4 or CMAF),
     * rather than the MPEG-2 form (also called TS chunks, which the HLS specification also supports). For more
     * information about HLS fragment types, see the <a
     * href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-23">HLS specification</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The following procedure shows how to use HLS with Kinesis Video Streams:
     * </p>
     * <ol>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Get an endpoint using <a
     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_GetDataEndpoint.html">GetDataEndpoint</a>,
     * specifying <code>GET_HLS_STREAMING_SESSION_URL</code> for the <code>APIName</code> parameter.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Retrieve the HLS URL using <code>GetHLSStreamingSessionURL</code>. Kinesis Video Streams creates an HLS streaming
     * session to be used for accessing content in a stream using the HLS protocol.
     * <code>GetHLSStreamingSessionURL</code> returns an authenticated URL (that includes an encrypted session token)
     * for the session's HLS <i>master playlist</i> (the root resource needed for streaming with HLS).
     * </p>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * Don't share or store this token where an unauthorized entity could access it. The token provides access to the
     * content of the stream. Safeguard the token with the same measures that you would use with your AWS credentials.
     * </p>
     * </note>
     * <p>
     * The media that is made available through the playlist consists only of the requested stream, time range, and
     * format. No other media data (such as frames outside the requested window or alternate bit rates) is made
     * available.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for the HLS master playlist to a media player that
     * supports the HLS protocol. Kinesis Video Streams makes the HLS media playlist, initialization fragment, and media
     * fragments available through the master playlist URL. The initialization fragment contains the codec private data
     * for the stream, and other data needed to set up the video decoder and renderer. The media fragments contain
     * H.264-encoded video frames and time stamps.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests stream metadata and media data normally. When the
     * media player requests data, it calls the following actions:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>GetHLSMasterPlaylist:</b> Retrieves an HLS master playlist, which contains a URL for the
     * <code>GetHLSMediaPlaylist</code> action, and additional metadata for the media player, including estimated bit
     * rate and resolution.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>GetHLSMediaPlaylist:</b> Retrieves an HLS media playlist, which contains a URL to access the MP4
     * initialization fragment with the <code>GetMP4InitFragment</code> action, and URLs to access the MP4 media
     * fragments with the <code>GetMP4MediaFragment</code> actions. The HLS media playlist also contains metadata about
     * the stream that the player needs to play it, such as whether the <code>PlaybackMode</code> is <code>LIVE</code>
     * or <code>ON_DEMAND</code>. The HLS media playlist is typically static for sessions with a
     * <code>PlaybackType</code> of <code>ON_DEMAND</code>. The HLS media playlist is continually updated with new
     * fragments for sessions with a <code>PlaybackType</code> of <code>LIVE</code>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>GetMP4InitFragment:</b> Retrieves the MP4 initialization fragment. The media player typically loads the
     * initialization fragment before loading any media fragments. This fragment contains the "<code>fytp</code>" and "
     * <code>moov</code>" MP4 atoms, and the child atoms that are needed to initialize the media player decoder.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in a Kinesis video stream. It contains only the
     * codec private data for the stream, which the media player needs to decode video frames.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>GetMP4MediaFragment:</b> Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These fragments contain the "<code>moof</code>" and "
     * <code>mdat</code>" MP4 atoms and their child atoms, containing the encoded fragment's video frames and their time
     * stamps.
     * </p>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming session, any fragments that don't contain the
     * same codec private data are excluded in the HLS media playlist. Therefore, the codec private data does not change
     * between fragments in a session.
     * </p>
     * </note>
     * <p>
     * Data retrieved with this action is billable. See <a
     * href="aws.amazon.comkinesis/video-streams/pricing/">Pricing</a> for details.

     * </ul>
     * </li>
     * </ol>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * The following restrictions apply to HLS sessions:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * A streaming session URL should not be shared between players. The service might throttle a session if multiple
     * media players are sharing it. For connection limits, see <a
     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/limits.html">Kinesis Video Streams Limits</a>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * A Kinesis video stream can have a maximum of five active HLS streaming sessions. If a new session is created when
     * the maximum number of sessions is already active, the oldest (earliest created) session is closed. The number of
     * active <code>GetMedia</code> connections on a Kinesis video stream does not count against this limit, and the
     * number of active HLS sessions does not count against the active <code>GetMedia</code> connection limit.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * </note>
     * <p>
     * You can monitor the amount of data that the media player consumes by monitoring the
     * <code>GetMP4MediaFragment.OutgoingBytes</code> Amazon CloudWatch metric. For information about using CloudWatch
     * to monitor Kinesis Video Streams, see <a
     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/monitoring.html">Monitoring Kinesis Video
     * Streams</a>. For pricing information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/">Amazon
     * Kinesis Video Streams Pricing</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/">AWS Pricing</a>. Charges for both
     * HLS sessions and outgoing AWS data apply.
