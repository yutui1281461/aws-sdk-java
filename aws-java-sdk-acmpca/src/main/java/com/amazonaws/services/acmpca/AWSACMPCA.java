/**
 * Interface for accessing ACM-PCA.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.acmpca.AbstractAWSACMPCA} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the ACM PCA API to create a private certificate authority (CA). You must first call the
 * <a>CreateCertificateAuthority</a> operation. If successful, the operation returns an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for
 * your private CA. Use this ARN as input to the <a>GetCertificateAuthorityCsr</a> operation to retrieve the certificate
 * signing request (CSR) for your private CA certificate. Sign the CSR using the root or an intermediate CA in your
 * on-premises PKI hierarchy, and call the <a>ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate</a> to import your signed private CA
 * certificate into ACM PCA.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use your private CA to issue and revoke certificates. These are private certificates that identify and secure client
 * computers, servers, applications, services, devices, and users over SSLS/TLS connections within your organization.
 * Call the <a>IssueCertificate</a> operation to issue a certificate. Call the <a>RevokeCertificate</a> operation to
 * revoke a certificate.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * Certificates issued by your private CA can be trusted only within your organization, not publicly.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * Your private CA can optionally create a certificate revocation list (CRL) to track the certificates you revoke. To
 * create a CRL, you must specify a <a>RevocationConfiguration</a> object when you call the
 * <a>CreateCertificateAuthority</a> operation. ACM PCA writes the CRL to an S3 bucket that you specify. You must
 * specify a bucket policy that grants ACM PCA write permission.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can also call the <a>CreateCertificateAuthorityAuditReport</a> to create an optional audit report that lists
 * every time the CA private key is used. The private key is used for signing when the <b>IssueCertificate</b> or
 * <b>RevokeCertificate</b> operation is called.
 * </p>
