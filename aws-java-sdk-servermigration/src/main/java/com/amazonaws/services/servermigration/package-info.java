 * This is the <i>AWS Sever Migration Service API Reference</i>. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples
 * for each of the actions and data types for the AWS Sever Migration Service (AWS SMS). The topic for each action shows
 * the Query API request parameters and the XML response. You can also view the XML request elements in the WSDL.
 * </p>

 * Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or
 * platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">AWS SDKs</a>.
