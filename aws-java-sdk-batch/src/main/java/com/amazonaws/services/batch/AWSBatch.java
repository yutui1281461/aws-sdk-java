/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS Batch.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.batch.AbstractAWSBatch} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common way for
 * developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources, and AWS Batch removes the
 * undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure. AWS Batch will be familiar to
 * users of traditional batch computing software. This service can efficiently provision resources in response to jobs
 * submitted in order to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver results quickly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As a fully managed service, AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and engineers to run batch computing workloads
 * of any scale. AWS Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based on
 * the quantity and scale of the workloads. With AWS Batch, there is no need to install or manage batch computing
 * software, which allows you to focus on analyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch reduces operational
 * complexities, saves time, and reduces costs, which makes it easy for developers, scientists, and engineers to run
 * their batch jobs in the AWS Cloud.

     * In a managed compute environment, AWS Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources
     * within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define or the <a
     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html">launch template</a> that you
     * specify when you create the compute environment. You can choose to use Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances or Spot

     * launch when the Spot Instance price is below a specified percentage of the On-Demand price.

     * <note>
     * <p>

     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html">Container Instance
     * AMIs</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. After you have created your unmanaged
     * compute environment, you can use the <a>DescribeComputeEnvironments</a> operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster
     * that is associated with it. Then, manually launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more
     * information, see <a
     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html">Launching an
