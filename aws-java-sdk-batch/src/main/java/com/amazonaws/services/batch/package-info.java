 * AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common way for
 * developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources, and AWS Batch removes the
 * undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure. AWS Batch will be familiar to
 * users of traditional batch computing software. This service can efficiently provision resources in response to jobs
 * submitted in order to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver results quickly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As a fully managed service, AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and engineers to run batch computing workloads
 * of any scale. AWS Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based on
 * the quantity and scale of the workloads. With AWS Batch, there is no need to install or manage batch computing
 * software, which allows you to focus on analyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch reduces operational
 * complexities, saves time, and reduces costs, which makes it easy for developers, scientists, and engineers to run
 * their batch jobs in the AWS Cloud.
