/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon WorkMail.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.workmail.AbstractAmazonWorkMail} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon WorkMail is a secure, managed business email and calendaring service with support for existing desktop and
 * mobile email clients. You can access your email, contacts, and calendars using Microsoft Outlook, your browser, or
 * their native iOS and Android email applications. You can integrate Amazon WorkMail with your existing corporate
 * directory and control both the keys that encrypt your data and the location in which your data is stored.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Amazon WorkMail API is designed for the following scenarios:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Listing and describing organizations
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Managing users
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Managing groups
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Managing resources
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All Amazon WorkMail API actions are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the
 * AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission
 * policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkMail site, the IAM user gains full
 * administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkMail organization (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes,
 * but is not limited to, the ability to create, update, and delete users, groups, and resources. This allows developers
 * to perform the scenarios listed above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis using
 * the IAM model.
 * </p>
