/**
 * <p>
 * AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10
 * gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct
 * Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the AWS cloud (for
 * example, to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)) and to Amazon
 * Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. An AWS Direct Connect
 * location provides access to AWS in the region it is associated with, as well as access to other US regions. For
 * example, you can provision a single connection to any AWS Direct Connect location in the US and use it to access
 * public AWS services in all US Regions and AWS GovCloud (US).
