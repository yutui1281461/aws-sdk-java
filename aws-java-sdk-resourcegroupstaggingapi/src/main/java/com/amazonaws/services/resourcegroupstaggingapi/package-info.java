/**
 * <fullname>Resource Groups Tagging API</fullname>
 * <p>
 * This guide describes the API operations for the resource groups tagging.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag consists of a key and a value, both of which you define.
 * For example, if you have two Amazon EC2 instances, you might assign both a tag key of "Stack." But the value of
 * "Stack" might be "Testing" for one and "Production" for the other.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Tagging can help you organize your resources and enables you to simplify resource management, access management and
 * cost allocation. For more information about tagging, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html">Working with Tag Editor</a> and <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/resource-groups.html">Working with Resource
 * Groups</a>. For more information about permissions you need to use the resource groups tagging APIs, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/obtaining-permissions-for-resource-groups.html"
 * >Obtaining Permissions for Resource Groups </a> and <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/obtaining-permissions-for-tagging.html">Obtaining
 * Permissions for Tagging </a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the resource groups tagging APIs to complete the following tasks:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Tag and untag supported resources located in the specified region for the AWS account
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Use tag-based filters to search for resources located in the specified region for the AWS account
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * List all existing tag keys in the specified region for the AWS account
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * List all existing values for the specified key in the specified region for the AWS account
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Not all resources can have tags. For a lists of resources that you can tag, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/supported-resources.html">Supported Resources</a> in
 * the <i>AWS Resource Groups and Tag Editor User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To make full use of the resource groups tagging APIs, you might need additional IAM permissions, including permission
 * to access the resources of individual services as well as permission to view and apply tags to those resources. For
 * more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/obtaining-permissions-for-tagging.html">Obtaining
 * Permissions for Tagging</a> in the <i>AWS Resource Groups and Tag Editor User Guide</i>.
