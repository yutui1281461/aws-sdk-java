/**
 * Interface for accessing CodeCommit.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.AbstractAWSCodeCommit} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS CodeCommit</fullname>
 * <p>
 * This is the <i>AWS CodeCommit API Reference</i>. This reference provides descriptions of the operations and data
 * types for AWS CodeCommit API along with usage examples.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the AWS CodeCommit API to work with the following objects:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Repositories, by calling the following:
 * </p>

 * <p>
 * <a>BatchGetRepositories</a>, which returns information about one or more repositories associated with your AWS
 * account.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>CreateRepository</a>, which creates an AWS CodeCommit repository.
 * </p>
