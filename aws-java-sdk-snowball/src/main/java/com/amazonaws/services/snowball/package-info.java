/**
 * <p>
 * AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of
 * data between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snowball commands
 * described here provide access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS Snowball Management Console,
 * which enables you to create and manage jobs for Snowball. To transfer data locally with a Snowball appliance, you'll
 * need to use the Snowball client or the Amazon S3 API adapter for Snowball. For more information, see the <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html">User Guide</a>.
