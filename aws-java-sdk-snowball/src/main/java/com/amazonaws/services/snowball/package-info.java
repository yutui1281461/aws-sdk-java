 * AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure devices to transfer large amounts of data
 * between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The commands described here
 * provide access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS Snowball Management Console, which enables you
 * to create and manage jobs for Snowball and Snowball Edge devices. To transfer data locally with a device, you'll need
 * to use the Snowball client or the Amazon S3 API adapter for Snowball.
