/**
 * <fullname>AWS Application Discovery Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects by automatically identifying servers,
 * virtual machines (VMs), software, and software dependencies running in your on-premises data centers. Application
 * Discovery Service also collects application performance data, which can help you assess the outcome of your
 * migration. The data collected by Application Discovery Service is securely retained in an AWS-hosted and managed
 * database in the cloud. You can export the data as a CSV or XML file into your preferred visualization tool or
 * cloud-migration solution to plan your migration. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/">AWS Application Discovery Service FAQ</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Application Discovery Service offers two modes of operation:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Agentless discovery</b> mode is recommended for environments that use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't
 * require you to install an agent on each host. Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the
 * operating systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure assessment. Agentless
 * discovery doesn't collect information about software and software dependencies. It also doesn't work in non-VMware
 * environments.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Agent-based discovery</b> mode collects a richer set of data than agentless discovery by using the AWS Application
 * Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your data center. The agent captures infrastructure and
 * application information, including an inventory of installed software applications, system and process performance,
 * resource utilization, and network dependencies between workloads. The information collected by agents is secured at
 * rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database in the cloud.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments and to collect information about software
 * and software dependencies. You can also run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless
 * discovery to quickly complete the initial infrastructure assessment and then install agents on select hosts.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Application Discovery Service integrates with application discovery solutions from AWS Partner Network (APN)
 * partners. Third-party application discovery tools can query Application Discovery Service and write to the
 * Application Discovery Service database using a public API. You can then import the data into either a visualization
 * tool or cloud-migration solution.
 * </p>
 * <important>
 * <p>
 * Application Discovery Service doesn't gather sensitive information. All data is handled according to the <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">AWS Privacy Policy</a>. You can operate Application Discovery Service offline
 * to inspect collected data before it is shared with the service.
 * </p>
 * </important>
 * <p>
 * This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for
 * Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows the API request parameters and the response.
 * Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or
 * platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">AWS SDKs</a>.
