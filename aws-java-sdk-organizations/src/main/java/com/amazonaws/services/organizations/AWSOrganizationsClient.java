/**
 * Client for accessing Organizations. All service calls made using this client are blocking, and will not return until
 * the service call completes.
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS Organizations API Reference</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple AWS accounts into an
 * <i>organization</i> and centrally manage your accounts and their resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations API. For more information about using this service, see the <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html">AWS Organizations User
 * Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>API Version</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This version of the Organizations API Reference documents the Organizations API version 2016-11-28.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * As an alternative to using the API directly, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample
 * code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, and more). The SDKs provide a
 * convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Organizations. For example, the SDKs take care of
 * cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about
 * the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon
 * Web Services</a>.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Organizations. However, you also can use the
 * Organizations Query API to make direct calls to the Organizations web service. To learn more about the Organizations
 * Query API, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_query-requests.html">Making
 * Query Requests</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>. Organizations supports GET and POST requests for all
 * actions. That is, the API does not require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests
 * are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Signing Requests</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you send HTTP requests to AWS, you must sign the requests so that AWS can identify who sent them. You sign
 * requests with your AWS access key, which consists of an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend
 * that you do not create an access key for your root account. Anyone who has the access key for your root account has
 * unrestricted access to all the resources in your account. Instead, create an access key for an IAM user account that
 * has administrative privileges. As another option, use AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security
 * credentials, and use those credentials to sign requests.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To sign requests, we recommend that you use <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>. If you have an
 * existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you do not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However,
 * some operations now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for operations that require version 4 indicate
 * this requirement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS SDKs to make requests to AWS, these tools
 * automatically sign the requests for you with the access key that you specify when you configure the tools.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In this release, each organization can have only one root. In a future release, a single organization will support
 * multiple roots.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Support and Feedback for AWS Organizations</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to <a
 * href="mailto:feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com">feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com</a> or post your feedback and
 * questions in the <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=219">AWS Organizations support forum</a>.
 * For more information about the AWS support forums, see <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa">Forums
 * Help</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Endpoint to Call When Using the CLI or the AWS API</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For the current release of Organizations, you must specify the <code>us-east-1</code> region for all AWS API and CLI
 * calls. You can do this in the CLI by using these parameters and commands:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its region:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>--endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code>
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this command:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>aws configure set default.region us-east-1</code>
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Use the following parameter with each command to specify the endpoint:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>--region us-east-1</code>
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For the various SDKs used to call the APIs, see the documentation for the SDK of interest to learn how to direct the
 * requests to a specific endpoint. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region">Regions and Endpoints</a> in the <i>AWS
 * General Reference</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>How examples are presented</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The JSON returned by the AWS Organizations service as response to your requests is returned as a single long string
 * without line breaks or formatting whitespace. Both line breaks and whitespace are included in the examples in this
 * guide to improve readability. When example input parameters also would result in long strings that would extend
 * beyond the screen, we insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit the input as a single JSON
 * text string.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Recording API Requests</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Organizations supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log
 * files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine which requests were
 * successfully made to Organizations, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS
 * Organizations and its support for AWS CloudTrail, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_monitoring.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration"
 * >Logging AWS Organizations Events with AWS CloudTrail</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>. To learn more
 * about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html">AWS CloudTrail
 * User Guide</a>.

    /**
     * <p>
     * Attaches a policy to a root, an organizational unit (OU), or an individual account. How the policy affects
     * accounts depends on the type of policy:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Service control policy (SCP)</b> - An SCP specifies what permissions can be delegated to users in affected
     * member accounts. The scope of influence for a policy depends on what you attach the policy to:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If you attach an SCP to a root, it affects all accounts in the organization.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If you attach an SCP to an OU, it affects all accounts in that OU and in any child OUs.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If you attach the policy directly to an account, then it affects only that account.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * SCPs essentially are permission "filters". When you attach one SCP to a higher level root or OU, and you also
     * attach a different SCP to a child OU or to an account, the child policy can further restrict only the permissions
     * that pass through the parent filter and are available to the child. An SCP that is attached to a child cannot
     * grant a permission that is not already granted by the parent. For example, imagine that the parent SCP allows
     * permissions A, B, C, D, and E. The child SCP allows C, D, E, F, and G. The result is that the accounts affected
     * by the child SCP are allowed to use only C, D, and E. They cannot use A or B because they were filtered out by
     * the child OU. They also cannot use F and G because they were filtered out by the parent OU. They cannot be
     * granted back by the child SCP; child SCPs can only filter the permissions they receive from the parent SCP.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * AWS Organizations attaches a default SCP named <code>"FullAWSAccess</code> to every root, OU, and account. This
     * default SCP allows all services and actions, enabling any new child OU or account to inherit the permissions of
     * the parent root or OU. If you detach the default policy, you must replace it with a policy that specifies the
     * permissions that you want to allow in that OU or account.

     * Enables all features in an organization. This enables the use of organization policies that can restrict the
     * services and actions that can be called in each account. Until you enable all features, you have access only to
     * consolidated billing, and you can't use any of the advanced account administration features that AWS
     * Organizations supports. For more information, see <a
     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html"
     * >Enabling All Features in Your Organization</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * <important>
     * <p>
     * This operation is required only for organizations that were created explicitly with only the consolidated billing
     * features enabled. Calling this operation sends a handshake to every invited account in the organization. The
     * feature set change can be finalized and the additional features enabled only after all administrators in the
     * invited accounts approve the change by accepting the handshake.
     * </p>
     * </important>
     * <p>
     * After you enable all features, you can separately enable or disable individual policy types in a root using
     * <a>EnablePolicyType</a> and <a>DisablePolicyType</a>. To see the status of policy types in a root, use
     * <a>ListRoots</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * After all invited member accounts accept the handshake, you finalize the feature set change by accepting the
     * handshake that contains <code>"Action": "ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES"</code>. This completes the change.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * After you enable all features in your organization, the master account in the organization can apply policies on
     * all member accounts. These policies can restrict what users and even administrators in those accounts can do. The
     * master account can apply policies that prevent accounts from leaving the organization. Ensure that your account
     * administrators are aware of this.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * This operation can be called only from the organization's master account.
