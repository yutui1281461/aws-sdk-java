 * <fullname>Amazon Simple Notification Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build distributed web-enabled
 * applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested
 * subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this product see <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/sns/">http://aws.amazon.com/sns</a>. For detailed information about Amazon SNS features
 * and their associated API calls, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/">Amazon SNS Developer
 * Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming language. The SDKs contain
 * functionality that automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests,
 * retrying requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.
