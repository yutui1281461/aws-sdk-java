/**
 * <p>
 * Set of rule statements, used with FlexMatch, that determine how to build a certain kind of player match. Each rule
 * set describes a type of group to be created and defines the parameters for acceptable player matches. Rule sets are
 * used in <a>MatchmakingConfiguration</a> objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A rule set may define the following elements for a match. For detailed information and examples showing how to
 * construct a rule set, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-rulesets.html">Build a FlexMatch Rule Set</a>.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Teams -- Required. A rule set must define one or multiple teams for the match and set minimum and maximum team sizes.
 * For example, a rule set might describe a 4x4 match that requires all eight slots to be filled.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Player attributes -- Optional. These attributes specify a set of player characteristics to evaluate when looking for
 * a match. Matchmaking requests that use a rule set with player attributes must provide the corresponding attribute
 * values. For example, an attribute might specify a player's skill or level.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Rules -- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players for a match based on player attributes. A rule
 * might specify minimum requirements for individual players, teams, or entire matches. For example, a rule might
 * require each player to meet a certain skill level, each team to have at least one player in a certain role, or the
 * match to have a minimum average skill level. or may describe an entire group--such as all teams must be evenly
 * matched or have at least one player in a certain role.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Expansions -- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules after a period of time when no acceptable matches are
 * found. This feature lets you balance getting players into games in a reasonable amount of time instead of making them
 * wait indefinitely for the best possible match. For example, you might use an expansion to increase the maximum skill
 * variance between players after 30 seconds.
 * </p>
