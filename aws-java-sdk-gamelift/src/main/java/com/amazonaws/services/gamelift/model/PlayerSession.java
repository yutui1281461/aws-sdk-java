/**
 * <p>
 * Properties describing a player session. Player session objects are created either by creating a player session for a
 * specific game session, or as part of a game session placement. A player session represents either a player
 * reservation for a game session (status <code>RESERVED</code>) or actual player activity in a game session (status
 * <code>ACTIVE</code>). A player session object (including player data) is automatically passed to a game session when
 * the player connects to the game session and is validated.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a player disconnects, the player session status changes to <code>COMPLETED</code>. Once the session ends, the
 * player session object is retained for 30 days and then removed.
