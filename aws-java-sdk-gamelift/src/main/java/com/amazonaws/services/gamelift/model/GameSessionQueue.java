/**
 * <p>
 * Configuration of a queue that is used to process game session placement requests. The queue configuration identifies
 * several game features:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The destinations where a new game session can potentially be hosted. Amazon GameLift tries these destinations in an
 * order based on either the queue's default order or player latency information, if provided in a placement request.
 * With latency information, Amazon GameLift can place game sessions where the majority of players are reporting the
 * lowest possible latency.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The length of time that placement requests can wait in the queue before timing out.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * A set of optional latency policies that protect individual players from high latencies, preventing game sessions from
 * being placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy's maximum.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Queue-related operations include:
