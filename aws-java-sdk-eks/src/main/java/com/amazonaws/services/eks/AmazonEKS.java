 * Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run
 * Kubernetes on AWS without needing to stand up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an
 * open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins
 * and tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications
 * running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This
 * means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification
 * required.

     * Creates an Amazon EKS control plane.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The Amazon EKS control plane consists of control plane instances that run the Kubernetes software, like
     * <code>etcd</code> and the API server. The control plane runs in an account managed by AWS, and the Kubernetes API
     * is exposed via the Amazon EKS API server endpoint.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Amazon EKS worker nodes run in your AWS account and connect to your cluster's control plane via the Kubernetes
     * API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load
     * Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to
     * provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the worker nodes (for example, to support
     * <code>kubectl exec</code>, <code>logs</code>, and <code>proxy</code> data flows).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * After you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes tooling to communicate with the API
     * server and launch worker nodes into your cluster. For more information, see <a
     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-auth.html">Managing Cluster Authentication</a> and
     * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html">Launching Amazon EKS Worker
