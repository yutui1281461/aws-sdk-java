/**
 * <p>
 * Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run
 * Kubernetes on AWS without needing to stand up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an
 * open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon EKS runs three Kubernetes control plane instances across three Availability Zones to ensure high availability.
 * Amazon EKS automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances, and it provides automated version
 * upgrades and patching for them.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon EKS is also integrated with many AWS services to provide scalability and security for your applications,
 * including the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Elastic Load Balancing for load distribution
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * IAM for authentication
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Amazon VPC for isolation
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Amazon EKS runs up to date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins
 * and tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications
 * running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This
 * means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification
 * required.
 * </p>
